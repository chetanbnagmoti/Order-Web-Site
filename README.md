# Order-Web-Site
Description: Order-Web-Site

Order-Web-Site is a web application built using Node.js as the backend framework and a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and EJS for the frontend. This project aims to provide a seamless user experience for customers to place orders online.

While the current version does not implement a database, future development will focus on integrating a database system to store and manage order information efficiently. The absence of a database at this stage allows for quick prototyping and testing of the application's core functionalities.

The Node.js backend serves as the foundation of the application, handling server-side operations such as routing, request handling, and data processing. HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and EJS are used to create a visually appealing and responsive frontend interface, ensuring a smooth user experience across different devices.

This repository serves as a collaborative space for developers to contribute to the project's growth and improvement. It provides a platform for enhancing the existing features, implementing new functionalities, and integrating a database system in the future.

Please note that this project is still under development, and contributions from the open-source community are highly encouraged. Together, we aim to build a robust and scalable Order-Web-Site that meets the needs of both customers and businesses in the digital age.
